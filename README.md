## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`app/page.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Flexie%2Freact-alpha-api%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Flexie%2Freact-alpha-api%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Flexie%2Freact-alpha-api%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A81%7D%7D%5D%5D 'Go to definition').
